 "Exercise 16: 

Implementing Responsive Design with Media Queries

Description:

background color of the <body> to white when the 
viewport width is less than 600px.

/* Media Query: Change background color of body to white when viewport width is less than 600px */
@media screen and (max-width: 600px) {
    body {
        background-color: white;  /* Change background color to white */
    }
